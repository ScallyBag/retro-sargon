The book "Sargon, a computer chess program", by Dan and Kathe Spracklen published by Hayden 1978
presents the source code to the classic early chess program Sargon in Z80 assembly language.
This is a project to bring the code back to life in the modern era.

Current status is that I am just getting started. I acknowledge the ownership of legendary
programmers Dan and Kathe Spracklen, and if they contact me in respect of this project, I will
honour their wishes, whatever they may be.

I have previously successfully done something similar with another early program, Microchess
by Peter Jennings. A google search should locate the code for that project, but I should
really bring it over to Github.
